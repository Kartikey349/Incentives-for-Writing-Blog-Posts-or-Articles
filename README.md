## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to create a decentralized platform that encourages knowledge sharing and rewards authors for their efforts in creating valuable content. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform ensures transparency, security, and fair compensation for contributors.

## Key Features
- **Article Submission**: Authors can submit their articles with a title and content.
- **Incentives System**: Administrators can reward authors with Ether as incentives.
- **Transparency**: The platform keeps track of all articles and the incentives paid.
- **Ownership Control**: Only the owner of the smart contract can distribute incentives.

## Future Improvements
- Enable voting mechanisms for users to upvote articles.
- Allow multiple administrators to distribute incentives.
